            <h1>Welcome to Machine Learning Trivia</h1>
            <p>This is trivia game of ML for 2 players. Each player should answer 10 questions and the one with the higher score wins.</p>
            <p>For the next game i will implement an improvement of this trivia, using Node.js. In that game, if a player finish playing and the other 
                player hadn't finished yet, the game will not finished until both player has finished playing the game to have the score. Also, i will implement
                a time controler for avoid extremly large games.
